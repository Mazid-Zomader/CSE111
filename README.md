Dear Publish team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to address an important issue that has come to my attention.

It has been observed that some of the content published on your platform bears striking 
similarities to the work of others without proper attribution. 
This practice, often referred to as plagiarism, is not only unethical
but also against the collaborative spirit of GitHub and the wider open-source community.

I understand that creating original content can be challenging, 
but it is crucial to respect the intellectual property rights of others. 
When using someone else's work, it is important to give credit where it's due 
and follow the license terms under which the work was shared.

I kindly request that you review your published content to ensure it adheres to these principles. 
Moving forward, I hope to see more original contributions or, where necessary, appropriate attribution to the original authors.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Best regards,

Mazid Zomader
